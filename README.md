Colon Cancer Image Classification using SqueezeNet Variants

This repository contains the implementation of colon cancer classification using histopathological images with SqueezeNet-based architectures. The study utilizes three different network configurations to evaluate performance:

Residual SqueezeNet with Dilation
Residual SqueezeNet without Dilation
SqueezeNet with Dilation
Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images
The image dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images. This dataset was originally uploaded to Google Drive for efficient access and processing.

Platform and Reproducibility

All computations were performed on Google Colab Pro to leverage faster GPU/TPU resources. Using Google Colab Pro significantly reduced computation time compared to local machines.
