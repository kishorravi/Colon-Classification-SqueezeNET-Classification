## 

This repository contains the implementation of colon cancer classification using histopathological images with SqueezeNet-based architectures. The study evaluates and compares three distinct network configurations to determine their performance:
- **Residual SqueezeNet with Dilation**  
- **Residual SqueezeNet without Dilation**  
- **SqueezeNet with Dilation** 

## Dataset

The image dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images. This dataset was initially uploaded to Google Drive for streamlined access during experimentation
